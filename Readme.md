# ware

  Easily create a middleware layer.

## Quickstart

```js
var ware = require('ware')();

ware.use(function (input, output, next) {
  output.x = input.x * 2;
  next();
});

ware.end({ x : 4 }, function (err, result) {
  console.log(result.x); // 8
});
```

## API

#### ware()

Create a new set of middleware.

#### .use(fn)

Adds a middleware function with the signature (input, output, next). Like express, if you add a function (err, input, output, next), this will act as the error handler.

```javascript
ware.use(function (input, output, next) {
  output.x = input.x * 2;
  next();
});
```

#### .end(input, fn)

Runs the middleware functions.

```javascript
ware.end(input, function (err, result) { /*...*/ });
```
